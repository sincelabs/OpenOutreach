# openoutreach/settings.py
"""Django settings for the orchestrator: one registry hosting both children's apps.

`openoutfind` and `cold_outreach` are Django projects in their own right, and each keeps
its own settings module — `uvx --from openoutfind outfind find 10` runs with nothing from
this package anywhere near it. They are also *reusable apps*, and this is a third host for
them: one `INSTALLED_APPS`, one SQLite file, one migration graph, one process — so a lead
the finder wrote and the mail the sender sent it are rows in the same store, and one
`migrate` brings the whole install current.

**What each child requires of a host lives in that child's `defaults.py`** and is splatted
here, so a name the apps start reading arrives from one definition rather than drifting
between three settings modules.

**There is no web surface in this process.** No URLconf, no Admin, no sessions, no
templates — the verbs are `find`, `send`, `status` and `run`, and the config surface is
the wizard. `SECRET_KEY` exists because Django insists on one; naming that in the value
is more honest than generating a secret nobody uses.

**`dashboard/` is a second, independent way to answer the wizard's questions — not a
second surface on this process.** It's a separate Next.js app that reads and writes the
`SiteConfig` row directly over SQLite, the same way any SQLite client could; nothing in
this settings module serves it a request. See CLAUDE.md and `dashboard/README.md`.

**This project has exactly one app and one model** — `openoutreach.config.SiteConfig`, the
answers a person gave. It is here because this is the program with a person in front of
it: the children are agent-first and read their configuration from the environment on
every run, keeping none of it, so somebody has to remember what was typed, and it is not
them. Nothing else belongs here — no pipeline model, no management command. That work
belongs in a child repo, released, then re-pinned.
